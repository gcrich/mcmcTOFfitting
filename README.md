**mcmcTOFfitting**
Created Dec 2016, g.c. rich

This project includes utilities associated with extraction of neutron energy distributions from observed neutron time-of-flight (TOF) spectra.
The goal is somewhat specific to a particular experiment, at least as the code is developed.
The particular experiment used a deuterium gas cell with a relatively low-energy deuteron beam to produce the neutrons; this combination leads to complex timing features due to energy loss, transit times, and cross section changes.


An effort will be made to have this project somewhat interpretable by others and perhaps suitable as a template for carrying out similar analyses in different experimental configurations.

In the absence of time to spend making this nicely packaged, it will for the time being rely on having its base directory included in PYTHONPATH.
